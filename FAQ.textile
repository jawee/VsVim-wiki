*How can I get feature X implemented / supported?*

Please file an issue on GitHub requesting this feature.  Issues are the primary way I track both bugs and feature requests.

*When I uninstall VsVim why do keys like Delete no longer work?*

Visual Studio by default contains a lot of key bindings which interfere with VsVim's ability to be a proper emulation of Vim.  As such on start up it will detect any key bindings which conflict and prompt the user to remove them.  These are not reset when VsVim is uninstalled.

There are two options for restoring the settings.  The first is to use the Vim Options page (accessible via the Options button on the margin).  From here you can reset the key bindings back to their original state.  

The other method is to reset your current profile.  This is much more impactful though and will have the effect of resetting other settings.  

bq. Tools -> Options -> Import / Export Settings

*How can I verify my .vimrc is loading?*

There are 2 non-standard vim settings that can be used to diagnose potential .vimrc load issues

* vimrc - This setting will display the full path of the file which was loaded for the .vimrc
* vimrcpaths - This setting will display the files and paths searched for .vimrc 

By default VsVim will look for a file named .vsvimrc, _vsvimrc, .vimrc or _vimrc file in the paths %HOME%, %VIM% and %USERPROFILE%

As of now the commands supported in the .vimrc file are limited to those supported in command mode.

*Integration with ReSharper, DevExpress, Visual Assist, etc ...*

Beta support for integration with ReSharper, CodeRush, etc ... is available now 

[[Beta Support Wiki Page|https://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim/wiki/3rd-party-plugin-support-(R%23,-Code-Rush,-etc-...)]]

Right now there is no explicit support for interaction with 3rd party editor extensions like ReSharper, DevExpressio, Visual Assist, etc ...  This support is coming and is the primary focus of the next version VsVim (0.9.4).  A beta is expected around 12/9

In the mean time if you reach a scenario where VsVim is interfering with actions like in place refactoring, you can <a href="#disable">temporarily disable it</a>, do the 3rd party action and then re-enable VsVim afterwards.  

<a name="#disable">
*Temporarily disabling VsVim*

VsVim can be temporairly disabled by the key sequence Ctrl+Shift+F12 and re-enabled later by the same key sequence.  While disabled VsVim will not interfere with any keyboard or selection allowing you to use Visual Studio as if VsVim wasn't installed.
