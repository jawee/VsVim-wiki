*How can I get feature X implemented / supported?*

Please file an issue on GitHub requesting this feature.  Issues is the primary way I track both bugs and feature requests.

Visual Studio by default contains a lot of key bindings which interfere with VsVim's ability to be a proper emulation of Vim.  As such on start up it will detect any key bindings which conflict and prompt the user to remove them.  These are not reset when VsVim is uninstalled.

In an ideal world I would have a button to reset the key bindings to their state before VsVim was installed.  It's just simply a feature I have not yet had time to implement.  

Until it's implemented you can work around this problem by reseting your profile.  This has the effect of resetting the key bindings as well.  

bq. Tools -> Options -> Import / Export Settings
