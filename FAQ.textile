*How can I get feature X implemented / supported?*

Please file an issue on GitHub requesting this feature.  Issues is the primary way I track both bugs and feature requests.

*When I uninstall VsVim why do keys like Delete no longer work?*

Visual Studio by default contains a lot of key bindings which interfere with VsVim's ability to be a proper emulation of Vim.  As such on start up it will detect any key bindings which conflict and prompt the user to remove them.  These are not reset when VsVim is uninstalled.

In an ideal world I would have a button to reset the key bindings to their state before VsVim was installed.  It's just simply a feature I have not yet had time to implement.  

Until it's implemented you can work around this problem by reseting your profile.  This has the effect of resetting the key bindings as well.  

bq. Tools -> Options -> Import / Export Settings

*How can I verify my .vimrc is loading (Beta only)?*

There are 2 non-standard vim settings that can be used to diagnose potential .vimrc load issues

* vimrc - This setting will display the full path of the file which was loaded for the .vimrc
* vmrcpaths - This setting will display the files and paths searched for .vimrc 

By default VsVim will look for a .vimrc or _vimrc file in the paths %HOME%, %VIM% and %USERPROFILE%

As of now the commands supported in the .vimrc file are limited to those supported in command mode.
